Description: Analysis of RNA-seq expression data or other similar kind
        of data. Exploratory plots to evualuate saturation, count
        distribution, expression per chromosome, type of detected
        features, features length, etc. Differential expression between
        two experimental conditions with no parametric assumptions.
