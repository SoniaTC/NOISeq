\title{
Plot to compare expression values for two conditions or to represent differential expression statistics
}
\description{
Function to represent three possible plots: one to compare the expression values in each condition, one also to compare the expression values in each condition but according to the chromosome and position within the chromosome, and the other one with the (M,D) statistics. In all three plots, the differentially expressed features may be highlighted.
}
\usage{
DE.plot(output, q = NULL, graphic = c("MD","expr","chrom"), pch = 20, cex = 0.5, col = 1, pch.sel = 1, cex.sel = 0.6, col.sel = 2,log.scale = TRUE, chromosomes = NULL, join = FALSE,...)
}

\arguments{

  \item{output}{
Object of class \code{\link{Output}}.
}
  \item{q}{
Probability of differential expression threshold to determine differentially expressed features.
}
  \item{graphic}{
String indicating which kind of plot is to be generated. If "expr", the feature expression values are depicted. If "MD", the values for the (M,D) statistics when comparing both conditions are used. If "chrom", the feature expression values are depicted across their positions in the chromosomes (if chromosome information has been provided).
}
  \item{pch, cex, col,...}{
Graphical parameters as in any other R plot. See \code{\link{par}}. They do not apply for graphic="chrom".
}
  \item{pch.sel, cex.sel, col.sel}{
\code{pch}, \code{cex} and \code{col}, respectively, to represent differentially expressed features. They do not apply for graphic="chrom".
}
  \item{log.scale}{
If TRUE, log2(data+K) values are depicted instead of the expression data in the \code{\link{Output}} object. K is an appropriate constant to avoid negative values. It does not apply for graphic="MD".
}
  \item{chromosomes}{
Character vector indicating the chromosomes (in roman numbers) to be plotted. If NULL, all chromosomes are plotted. It only applies for graphic="chrom".
}
  \item{join}{
If FALSE, each chromosome is depicted in a separate line. If TRUE, all the chromosomes are depicted in the same line, consecutively (useful for prokaryote organisms). It only applies for graphic="chrom".
}

\examples{
## We load the object generated after running noiseq on Marioni's data
data(noiseq)

## Third, plot the expression values for all genes and highlighting the differentially expressed genes
DE.plot(mynoiseq, q = 0.8, graphic = "expr", log.scale = TRUE)
DE.plot(mynoiseq, q = 0.8, graphic = "MD", ylim = c(0,50))
DE.plot(mynoiseq, chromosomes = c("I","II"), log.scale = TRUE,join = FALSE, q = 0.8, graphic = "chrom")
