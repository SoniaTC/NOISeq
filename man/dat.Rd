\title{
Exploration of expression data.
}
\description{
Take the expression data and the feature annotations to generate the results that will be used for the exploratory plots (\code{explo.plot}) or saved by the user to perform other analyses.
}
\usage{
dat(input, type = c("biodetection","cd","countsbio","GCbias","lengthbias","saturation"), 
                    k = 0, ndepth = 6, factor = NULL, norm = FALSE, refColumn = 1)
}

\arguments{
  \item{input}{
Object of eSet class with expression data and optional annotation.
}
  \item{type}{
Type of plot for which the data are to be generated. It can be one of: "biodetection","cd","countsbio","GCbias","lengthbias","saturation".
}
  \item{k}{
A feature is considered to be detected if the corresponding number of read counts is > k. By default, k = 0. This parameter is used by all types except "cd".
}
  \item{ndepth}{
Number of different sequencing depths to be simulated and plotted. By default, ndepth = 5. This parameter is only used by types "countsbio","DLbio" and "saturation".
}
  \item{factor}{
If factor = NULL (default), the calculations are done for each sample independently. When the factor is specified, the calculations are done for each experimental condition. 
Samples within the same condition are summed up ("biodetection") or averaged ("countsbio", "GCbias" and "lengthbias").
}
  \item{norm}{
To indicate if provided data are already normalized (TRUE) or they are raw data (FALSE), which is the default. This parameter is only used by type "cd".
}
  \item{refColumn}{
Column number in input data that is taken as the reference sample to compute M values. This parameter is only used by type "cd".
}
}


\value{
\code{dat()} function returns an S4 object to be used by \code{explo.plot()} or to be converted into a more friendly formatted object by the \code{dat2save()} function.

\examples{
## Load the input object with the expression data and the annotations
data(myCounts)

## Generating data for the plot "biodetection" and samples in columns 3 and 4 of expression data
mydata2plot = dat(mydata, type = "biodetection", k = 0)

## Generating the corresponding plot
explo.plot(mydata2plot, samples = c(3,4))
